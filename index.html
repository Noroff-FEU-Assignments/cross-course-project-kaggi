            <p>
              We at Square Eyes love films and want to help those who love films
              as much as we do! That is why we created this streaming service â€“ to
              bring together those who are passionate about creating films and
              those who are passionate about watching high quality films.
            </p>
            <p>
              Square Eyes is a place where young, aspiring filmmakers can present
              their work to those for whom they are creating - their viewers. Our
              mission is to help young independent creators promote their
              creativity, give them the opportunity to show their work and get
              feedback, and start making money without investing heavily in
              advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              We work for both independent creators and those who are interested
              in new directions in the art of cinema, who want to discover new
              names and support young film makers in their difficult career start.
            </p>
            <p>The site is free for creators. Viewers pay per view.</p>
            <p>Only registered users can watch full films.</p>
